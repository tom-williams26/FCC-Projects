# FCC-Projects
A portfolio of projects consisting of vanilla JavaScript. 

Over the past 6 months I have been taking Free Code Camp's Algorithms & Data Structures course. I have learnt so much by taking this course and using external resources like MDN and W3schools. 

## NOTE: I still have the two projects left to complete being the Telephone number Validator (US) and a cash register to build.

## The course included: 

Basic JavaScript - Learning the fundamental programming concepts and using basic data structures.

ES6 (ECMAScript) - Using new features like 'let' and 'const' as well as arrow functions, classes, promises and modules.

Regular Expressions - Patterns that are used to match, search and replace text. Also positive and negative lookaheads.

Debugging - looking for bugs within my code, finding any issues and fixing them using the console.

Basic Data Structures - Learning the difference between arrays and objects and using helpful JS methods like splice() and Object.keys() to access and manipulate data.

Basic Algorithm Scripting - Taking a problem and breaking it down into a step-by-step process and thinking carefully about how to solve each step with code.

Object Oriented Programming - Basic OOP principles in JavaScript, including the 'this' keyword prototype chains, constructors, and inheritance.

Functional Programming - Learning the concepts of functional programming including pure functions, how to avoid mutuations, and how to write cleaner code with methods like .map() and .filter().

Intermediate Algorithm Scripting - With the basics of algorithm thinking, OOP and functional programming under my belt. In this section my skills were put to the test in solving many intermediate scripting challenges.

By completing all of the course criteria it has put me into a position where I can show off my skills and build 5 projects in order to achieve my certification in this course and also show others.
